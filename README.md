# DSA-Project
Music-web project for DSA at UIT

I have made some changes to the features I mentioned in the Project Report:
    + Instead of using R2, I now use a VPS (my friend's VPS) to store music files.
    + I have written the backend using Flask (Python) and saved the file in a folder on the VPS.
    + I use a .json file to store information about each song.
    + I use the Fetch API to retrieve music for the website.
